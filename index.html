        		<p class="description">
        			I, <strong>Dhananjay Patania</strong>, am a aspiring web-developer residing in <strong>Kolkata</strong>. I have completed
        			B.tech in Computer Science in the year 2015. I had been an average student during my college life.  Previously, I was not much fond of learning web related topics but now I have started liking them and they seem quite interesting.
        			<br> <br>
        			This was all about academics. My hobbies include playing and watching cricket, writing(rhymes, short stories or anything randomly about emotions, situations and news). I love reading technological stuffs. In my free time, I like listening songs. My favourite color includes all shades of blue, so that might give a different taste to my web designing abilities, though the final decision depends on a client's preference. <br>
        		    Thank you.

        	<p class="paragraph">With the advent of mobile devices connecting the virtual world, the demand for responsive websites have changed the way websites are designed and maintained. I have enrolled in the <strong>MEAN</strong> stack development course, which includes JavaScript, NodeJs, AngularJs, MongoDB, ExpressJS. In the next level of the course, I will be learning about <strong>BootStrap</strong>. I had programming experience in C and Java. Presently, I am exploring the dynamics of front-end development with the help of HTML5 and CSS3. Other than that, in future, I am looking forward to try my hands on <strong>Python</strong>. I have heard good things about it, it seems intriguing.</p>
